Awesome ‚Äî let‚Äôs level up your Terraform game by replacing `null_resource` with more modular, event-driven, and cloud-native approaches. Since you're already deep into AWS, Terraform, and automation, here are three powerful alternatives tailored to your workflow:

---

## üîÅ 1. Replace with AWS Lambda + EventBridge

Instead of using `null_resource` to run scripts, trigger a Lambda function using [Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-eventbridge.html).

### ‚úÖ Benefits:
- Fully serverless and scalable
- Decouples logic from Terraform
- Easier to monitor and retry

### üß± Terraform Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_lambda_function" "bootstrap" {
  filename         = "bootstrap.zip"
  function_name    = "bootstrap-handler"
  role             = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.arn
  handler          = "index.handler"
  runtime          = "python3.9"
  source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("bootstrap.zip")
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "on_deploy" {
  name        = "trigger-bootstrap"
  event_pattern = jsonencode({
    "source": ["aws.ec2"],
    "detail-type": ["EC2 Instance State-change Notification"]
  })
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_target" "lambda_target" {
  rule      = aws_cloudwatch_event_rule.on_deploy.name
  target_id = "bootstrap"
  arn       = aws_lambda_function.bootstrap.arn
}
```

You can trigger this on EC2 creation, ALB registration, or even custom tags.

---

## üß© 2. Use `terraform_external` Data Source

For dynamic values or scripts that need to run during plan/apply, use the [`external`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs/language/data-sources/external) data source.

### üß™ Example:

```hcl
data "external" "generate_config" {
  program = ["python3", "${path.module}/scripts/gen_config.py"]
}

resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "config" {
  name  = "/app/config"
  type  = "String"
  value = data.external.generate_config.result["config"]
}
```

This lets you run Python, Bash, or any CLI tool and feed the result directly into Terraform-managed resources.

---

## üß† 3. Use `terraform_data` (Terraform 1.4+)

If you just need to run provisioners without managing a resource, `terraform_data` is the modern replacement.

```hcl
resource "terraform_data" "run_script" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "bash setup.sh"
  }
}
```

Cleaner, more intentional, and better aligned with Terraform‚Äôs evolution.

---

## üßµ Bonus: Modularize with Terragrunt or TF Modules

Instead of embedding logic in `null_resource`, consider:
- Creating reusable modules for bootstrapping
- Using Terragrunt hooks (`before_hook`, `after_hook`) for orchestration
- Leveraging CI/CD pipelines to trigger post-deploy actions
