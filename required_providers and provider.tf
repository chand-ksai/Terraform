Question:

do we have to explicitly metion provider block even after mentioning the required provider block ?

Great question! In Terraform, the `required_providers` block and the `provider` block serve **different purposes**, and whether you need to explicitly define the `provider` block depends on your use case.

### ✅ `terraform { required_providers { ... } }`
This block:
- **Declares which providers** your configuration depends on.
- Specifies the **source** and **version** of the provider.
- Is used by Terraform to **download and install** the correct provider plugin.

### ✅ `provider "aws" { ... }`
This block:
- **Configures the provider**, such as setting the region, credentials, or other options.
- Is **required** if you need to customize the provider's behavior.

---

### So, do you need both?

- **Yes**, in most real-world cases:
  - `required_providers` tells Terraform *what* to install.
  - `provider` tells Terraform *how* to use it.

### When can you skip the `provider` block?
You can omit the `provider "aws"` block **only if**:
- You're using **default configuration** (e.g., credentials and region are set via environment variables or shared config files).
- You don’t need to configure multiple provider instances or aliases.

---

### Example:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "6.0.0-beta2"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

Let me know if you’re working with multiple AWS accounts or regions — that would require provider aliases, and I can show you how to set that up too!
