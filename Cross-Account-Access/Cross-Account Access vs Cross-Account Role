### üõ°Ô∏è Cross-Account Access
This is the **general concept** of allowing one AWS account (Account A) to access resources in another account (Account B). 

There are two main ways to implement this:
1. **Resource-based policies**: Attach a policy directly to a resource (like an S3 bucket) that specifies which external account or principal can access it.
2. **IAM roles**: Create a role in Account B that Account A can assume, granting temporary access to resources.

### üë• Cross-Account Role
This is a **specific implementation** of cross-account access using IAM roles. 

It involves:

- Creating a role in Account B with a **trust policy** that allows principals from Account A to assume it.
- Assigning **permissions** to that role to define what actions it can perform.
- Using **STS (Security Token Service)** in Account A to call `AssumeRole`, temporarily gaining the permissions of the role in Account B.

|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Scope                      | Broad concept                            | Specific method using IAM roles             |
| Setup                      | Resource policy or role-based            | Always role-based with trust + permission   |
| Flexibility                | Depends on service support               | Works across most AWS services              |
| Use Case                   | Sharing S3 buckets, Lambda functions     | Delegating admin access, CI/CD pipelines    |
| Security Granularity       | Resource-level                           | Role-level with fine-grained control        |
