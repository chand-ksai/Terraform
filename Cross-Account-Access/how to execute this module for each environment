how to execute this module for each environment will it creates single state file for all 3 environments are it creates separate state files each environment


Excellent question—and it touches on one of the most important aspects of Terraform architecture: **state isolation**.

### ✅ Best Practice: Separate State Files per Environment

Each environment (dev, staging, prod) should have its **own Terraform state file**. This ensures:

- 🔒 **Isolation**: Changes in one environment don’t affect others.
- 🧪 **Safe Testing**: You can experiment in dev without risking prod.
- 📊 **Clear Auditing**: Easier to track who changed what, where.
- 🚀 **Parallel Deployments**: You can deploy environments independently.

### 🛠️ How to Execute the Module per Environment

Let’s say you have this folder structure:

```
terraform/
├── modules/
│   └── cross_account_role/
├── envs/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   └── main.tf
│   ├── staging/
│   │   └── main.tf
│   └── prod/
│       └── main.tf
```

You would run Terraform separately in each environment folder:

#### 🔹 Dev
```bash
cd terraform/envs/dev
terraform init
terraform apply
```

#### 🔹 Staging
```bash
cd terraform/envs/staging
terraform init
terraform apply
```

#### 🔹 Prod
```bash
cd terraform/envs/prod
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Each folder maintains its **own `.terraform` directory and `terraform.tfstate` file**.

### ☁️ Optional: Use Remote State (Recommended)

To avoid local state files and enable collaboration, use **remote state backends** like S3 + DynamoDB. Example for `envs/dev/backend.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-south-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}
```

You’d change the `key` for each environment:
- `dev/terraform.tfstate`
- `staging/terraform.tfstate`
- `prod/terraform.tfstate`
